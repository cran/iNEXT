\title{ggplot2 extension for an iNEXT Object}
\usage{
ggiNEXT(x, type = 1, se = TRUE, facet.var = "none", color.var = "order")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a \code{iNEXT} object computed by \code{\link{iNEXT}}}

\item{type}{three different plotting \code{type = c(1, 2, 3)}; \code{1} means to plot number of individuals or number of samples to diversity;
\code{2} means to plot number of individuals or number of samples to sample coverage; and \code{3} means to plot sample coverage to diversity.}

\item{se}{display confidence interval around estimated accumulation curve}

\item{facet.var}{display subsets of the dataset in different panels with four choices: \code{facet.var = c("none", "order", "site", "both")} where \code{"none"} means do not split any lay out panels in a grid; \code{"order"} means split lay out panels by different orders q; \code{"site"} means split lay out panels by different sites; and \code{"both"} means split lay out panels by order and sites.}

\item{color.var}{display subsets of the dataset in different colors with four choices: \code{color.var = c("none", "order", "site", "both")} where \code{"none"} means do not split any color; \code{"order"} means split colors by different orders q; \code{"site"} means split colors by different sites; and \code{"both"} means split colors by order and sites.}
