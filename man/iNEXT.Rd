\title{iNterpolation and EXTrapolation of Hill number}
\usage{
iNEXT(x, q = 0, datatype = "abundance", size = NULL, endpoint = NULL,
  knots = 40, se = TRUE, nboot = 50)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a vector of species abundance or incidence frequency. If \code{datatype = "incidence"}, then the input format of first entry should be total number of sampling units, and followed by species incidence frequency.
Note that in iNEXT version 2.0, the input arguments allow the class of \code{\link{numeric}}, \code{\link{matrix}}, \code{\link{data.frame}} (species by sites), or \code{\link{list}}.}

\item{q}{a numeric value, the order of Hill number .}

\item{datatype}{the data type of input data. That is individual-based abundance data (\code{datatype = "abundance"}) or sample-based incidence data (\code{datatype = "incidence"}).}

\item{size}{an integer vector of rarefaction/extrapolation sample size (number of individuals or sampling units), default is NULL. If \code{size} is not be specified, it would compute rarefaction/extrapolation by endpoint and knots.}

\item{endpoint}{a integer of sample size that is the endpoint for rarefaction/extrapolation. Default is double reference sample size.}

\item{knots}{a number of knots (say K, default is 40) specifying separate sample size between 1 and \code{endpoint}.
If \code{endpoint} is smaller than reference sample size, then \code{iNEXT()} compute rarefaction part only and divided by approximately equall spaced K.
If \code{endpoint} os larger than reference sample size, then \code{iNEXT()} will compute approximately K/2 equally spaced for rarefaction part and divided extrapolation part as approximately K/2 equally spaced between reference sample size and \code{endpoint}.}

\item{se}{calculate bootstrap standard error and show 95\% confidence interval; default is TRUE.}

\item{nboot}{the number of bootstrap resampling times, default is 50.}
}
\value{
a list of interpolation and extrapolation Hill number with specific order q (qD) and sample coverage (SC)
